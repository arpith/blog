# [Jonathan Jones on Drawing](http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2011/mar/21/michael-fay-war-drawings)

> A bold, manly line delineates damaged faces and bodies, but with a softening edge of affection.

Fay's drawings have a disarming humanity that it is hard to imagine being captured by a TV camera.



Michael Fay's online series at the New York Times, drawings at the military veterans' hospital at Richmond.
