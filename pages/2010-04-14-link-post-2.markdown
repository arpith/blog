> I honestly feel bad for Cuil. They got too much press too early in their development, and what they were showing was clearly not ready to receive such scrutiny. Worse, it had been hyped by the press as a “Google-killer”. Their basic web search at the time was still young, slow, and bad, so they got slammed in the press and quickly became a laughingstock of our industry, even temporarily moreso than the Zune.
