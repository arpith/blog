> Hi, Steve. I’m not usually one to write in like this. But, I’m so disappointed with the Apple iPad Case that I feel I need to share my concerns with you. The case is simply not worthy of you, Apple, or the iPad.

The bottom of the case in landscape mode becomes the inside of the case in portrait mode, which gets stuff on the iPad screen. And, while the case is a huge pleasure to use at an angle in landscape mode, it is ungainly and uncomfortable to use in portrait mode. I would also love a case that works with Apple’s iPad Dock and am disappointed to see Apple’s own case doesn’t work with Apple’s own dock.
