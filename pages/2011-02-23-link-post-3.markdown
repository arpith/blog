> Yes, you can say that Radiohead’s an evolutionary band, but it’s been a pretty intra-species evolution, with fewer of the fits and jumps of someone like David Bowie or even the convolutions The Beatles had to make (along with everyone else) in a much shorter time frame. I mean, even the “new”/“experimental” stuff that Radiohead’s added to their alternative rock foundation over the last fifteen years isn’t anything that would be unrecognizable to smart musical audiences in 1993.
