# [ISO50 on Design in Print](http://blog.iso50.com/2010/05/06/the-paris-review/)

> I came across a beautiful set of [The Paris Review](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paris_Review) covers over at [Belacquashua’s Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/38556985@N07/sets/72157622956222985/with/4251242768/) today. The Paris Review is still around (see current site [here](http://www.theparisreview.com/)) but apparently they fired their art director around 1970, because [this](http://donswaim.com/images/ripley-parisreview.jpg) isn’t exactly moving design.
