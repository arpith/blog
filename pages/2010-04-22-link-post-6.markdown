> We are thrilled to release a solve-the-resistor CAPTCHA plugin for WordPress! This plugin will draw a random 5% or 10% resistor and four color band sliders beneath it. The commenter needs to match the colors on the sliders to the colors on the resistor.

[I wish](http://garfieldminusgarfield.net/post/533575441/the-man-the-legend-the-misery-the-book) effort was spent in making them less annoying.  But I guess that comes with trying to prove to someone that you're _not_ like them.
