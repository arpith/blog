> It’s also a slap in the face that Apple is listing iBooks in the App Store, since they employ technical measures to ensure that every other App Store app doesn’t call any undocumented or private APIs. Their own apps wouldn’t pass the App Store submission process, yet developers need to compete with them for App Store attention. One of the great potential failures of an app-review system is inconsistent or unfair enforcement of the rules.

Lol.
