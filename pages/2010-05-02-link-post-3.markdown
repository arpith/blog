> [John Gruber’s recent analysis of Apple’s policy](http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/middleware_and_section_311) is, I think, almost exactly correct. He is right to pinpoint PowerPlant/Metrowerks as a source of Apple’s anxiety. ([Tinderbox](http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/) is still struggling with that one.) Java was another bad memory for Apple. An even worse memory, I think, is OpenDoc – the platform on which Apple bet the company, and lost.
