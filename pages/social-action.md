Gary LosHuertos used [Firesheep][2] in an attempt to dissuade users from broadcasting cookies over unprotected WiFi, only to discover that wasn't enough.

> Around half an hour later, I'd collected somewhere between 20 and 40 identities. Since Facebook was by far the most prevalent (and contains more personal information than Twitter) I decided to send the users messages from their own accounts to warn them of their accounts' exposure. I drafted a friendly, generic message that stated the location of the Starbucks, what the vulnerability was, and how to avoid it. I sent messages to around 20 people.

> I cleared the sidebar, took off my headphones, and waited. I heard one expletive muttered a few feet away, and wondered if my message was the cause. Over the next 15 minutes, I didn't hear anyone talk about what had happened (and folks at Starbucks are usually not ones to keep their conversations private). However, what I did see happen was a sharp decline in the number of identities I was collecting when I restarted Firesheep.

> This was relieving -- these people got the message. Hopefully they'll tell their friends, hide their kids, hide their wives. I cleared the sidebar once again, and after another twenty minutes of mindless conversation I saw five familiar names had returned to my herd.



Reminders like these make the results of [The Ugly Indian][3] all the more remarkable.
