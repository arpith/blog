# [Hirst's Greatest Hit](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/6329047/It-couldnt-get-worse-for-Damien-Hirst.html)

> Ordering his art to be made by other people over the telephone, which earned Hirst such admiration and notoriety in the 1990s, had been done by the Hungarian artist Laszlo Moholy-Nagy in 1924. Indeed, the very name is telling: while the names of other modern art movements, from Cubism to Pop, tell you about their intentions, the term YBA says nothing more than that they were young and British.

Everyone agrees [the exhibition at the Wallace Collection](http://www.wallacecollection.org/collections/exhibition/77) was pretty stupid, it would be funny if that was the point.  In contrast, [Timothy Taylor Gallery's Scully exhibition](http://www.timothytaylorgallery.com/exhibitions/sean-scully1) looks pretty delightful.
