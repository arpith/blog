> Still, I had plenty of concerns. Jeff's approach to business had been very different from my own. One of the ways that Amazon tries to deliver a great customer experience is by offering low prices, whereas at Zappos we don't try to compete on price. If Amazon gets a lot of customer service calls, it will try to figure out why -- maybe there's something confusing about the product description -- and then it will try to fix the problem so that it can reduce the number of phone calls, which keeps prices low. But at Zappos, we _want_ people to call us.
