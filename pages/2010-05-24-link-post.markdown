> Pizza is a true specialty item and a real art. It takes passion to make it right. I am not a restaurateur. But I do have a passion for doing this right. I'm not going to give you the 'easy home version'. I'm going to give you the version that makes the best pie I know how to make, even if it takes a bit more effort (ok, more than just a bit)

> There are a lot of variables for such a simple food. But these 3 FAR outweigh the others:
>
> 1. High Heat
> 2. Kneading Technique
> 3. The kind of yeast culture or "starter" used along with proper fermentation technique
