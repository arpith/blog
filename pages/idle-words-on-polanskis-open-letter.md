> >It is true: 33 years ago I pleaded guilty, and I served time at the prison for common law crimes at Chino, not in a VIP prison. That period was to have covered the totality of my sentence. By the time I left prison, the judge had changed his mind and claimed that the time served at Chino did not fulfil the entire sentence, and it is this reversal that justified my leaving the United States.

> Polanski refers here to 42 days he spent in Chino under 'psychiatric evaluation' prior to sentencing. The sentence was never pronounced, because Polanski ran away.
