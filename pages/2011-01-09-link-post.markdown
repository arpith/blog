> The information demanded by the DOJ is sweeping in scope.  It includes all mailing addresses and billing information known for the user, all connection records and session times, all IP addresses used to access Twitter, all known email accounts, as well as the "means and source of payment," including banking records and credit cards.  It seeks all of that information for the period beginning November 1, 2009, through the present.  A copy of the Order served on Twitter, obtained exclusively by Salon, is [here](http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2011/01/07/twitter/subpoena.pdf).

Presumably not just from Twitter.
