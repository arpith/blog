# [About that Microsoft Kin](http://www.marco.org/576242704)

> Oh yeah, there’s Ballmer. But he seems only reactive to immediate and operational needs, lacking the creativity, foresight, insight, or focus to steer the company in any new or even coherent directions. He’s like a low-level operations manager who got promoted too far via the Peter Principle. He can keep the company going on its established path, but he misses every major new market opportunity, and when something important breaks, he doesn’t know what to do.

Everyone seems to agree that no-one has a clue.
