# [Mathis on iPhone OS 4.0](http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2010/04/15/iphone_os_4_0/)

> I know I complained about folders earlier, but I think Apple’s implementation of folders in 4.0 is really well done. Hierarchies are typically a bad idea because they make things invisible. People forget or do not understand where they put their items, and can’t easily find them. Apple’s implementation solves this problem by doing two things:
> 
>   1. Apple’s folders show their contents
>   2. Apple doesn’t allow nested folders
