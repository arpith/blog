# [The Battle of Trafalgar](http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2010/may/25/yinka-shonibare-fourth-plinth-turner)

> Turner sets out to paint the smoke of war more hauntingly than his rival Philippe-Jacques de Loutherbourg, a stage painter who turned his hand to battle scenes. In fact, Turner's Trafalgar was commissioned as a pendant to de Loutherbourg's [The Battle of the First of June, 1794](http://www.nmm.ac.uk/mag/pages/mnuExplore/PaintingDetail.cfm?lettera=&ID=BHC0470&name=Philippe-Jacques%20de%20Loutherbourg&action=ArtistTitle).

> Both paintings show the suffering of a sea battle amid the smoke. It is Turner's troubling vision of war that clings at your mind.
