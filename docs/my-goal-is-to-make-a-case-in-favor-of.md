<blockquote><p>… my goal is to make a case in favor of awkwardness, arguing that it holds a certain promise and that in some cases radical awkwardness can be a good thing, not only something we can tolerate but something we can embrace. </p>

<p>In order to get to this counterintuitive conclusion, I will be employing the dialectic form of argument, most commonly associated with the name of another German philosopher, G. W. F. Hegel…</p>

<p>My investigation of everyday awkwardness in the context of work will focus on <em>The Office</em>, in both its original and US versions. For the cultural awkwardness associated with the problem of family life and coming of age, I will look at the films of Judd Apatow, centered as they are on the travails of “overgrown adolescents.” Finally, for the radical awkwardness represented first of all by cross-cultural tensions, I will look at Larry David’s <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm.</em>
