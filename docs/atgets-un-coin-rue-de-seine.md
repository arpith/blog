# [Atget's Un Coin, Rue de Seine](http://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2010/05/31/un-coin-rue-de-seine/)

> During the sleepy hours of the morning or night, Atget portrayed cobblestone courtyards, public-squares, parks, shop-fronts and buildings with a flair and a style that would transform plain documentary photography into high art. Even though Atgetâ€™s storefront images are devoid of people, there are unmistakable human qualities about them, and they captured the very essence of the Belle Epoque.
