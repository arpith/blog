> I think the "stylistic variations" analysis is basically the right one, but if we are looking for a description of the distinctively Yodic word order that Lane and so many others have picked up on, I don't think OSV, or XSV, is the best way of characterizing it. It seems to me that the prototypical Yodic matrix declarative clause takes the form *Pred S Aux*, where *Pred* is the predicate—a verb phrase, a predicative adjective phrase, or a predicative (or even possessed) noun phrase—*S* is the subject, and *Aux*  is one or more 'auxiliary' verbs, in which category I include (for present purposes) progressive and passive _be_, perfective _have_,  modals, copular _be_, and possibly even the main verb _have_.
