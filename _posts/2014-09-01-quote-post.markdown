<blockquote><p>These are the voices of the pastors calling<br/>
And calling like the long echoes in long sleep,<br/>
Generations of shepherd to generations of sheep. </p>

<p>Each truth is a sect though no bells ring for it. <br/>
And the bells belong to the sections, after all,<br/>
As they jangle and dangle and kick their feet.</p></blockquote>
