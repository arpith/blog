> Jeff Jarvis gets at the core issue with his post [“Confusing *a* public with *the* public”](http://www.buzzmachine.com/2010/05/08/confusing-a-public-with-the-public/). As I’ve said time and time again, people do want to engage in public, but not the same public that includes all of you. Jarvis relies on Habermas, but the right way to read this is through the ideas of [Michael Warner’s “Publics and Counterpublics”](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1890951285/apophenia-20). Facebook was originally a counterpublic, a public that people turned to because they didn’t like the publics that they had accessed to. What’s happening now is ripping the public that was created to shreds and people’s discomfort stems from that.
