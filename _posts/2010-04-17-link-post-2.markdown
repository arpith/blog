> My students seem to have a similar experience when they bump into me off campus. At first, they just cannot figure out who I am but they are sure they know me. Then, a second later, they figure it out—hey, that’s my teacher. They always think it is so funny and ask, “What are you doing here?” A teacher’s existence away from school comes as a surprise to them. What could I possibly be doing outside? I wonder the same thing about my typefaces when I see them out in the world, away the shelter of my studio, doing their own thing.

Pleasant read.
