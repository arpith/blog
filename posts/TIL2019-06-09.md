# Things I learnt 9 June 2019
## Networking
* `uname -a` on ec2 instances at work prints the name we've associated with the instance
* `ifconfig` is a quick way to get the instance's private ip
* `telnet IP PORT` can be used to verify that you can connect to an IP on that port
* you should check that the security group for the instance includes an inbound rule that allows connections on that port :) 
* `ssh -L 80:localhost:80 example.com` opens an SSH tunnel to localhost on the server on port 80. Note that you need to keep this SSH connection open while you use the tunnel.

## Consul
* [`consul operator raft list-peers`](https://www.consul.io/docs/commands/operator/raft.html) displays the current Raft peer configuration
* [`consul members`](https://www.consul.io/docs/commands/members.html) outputs the current list of members that a Consul agent knows about, along with their state
* [`consul join -wan $SERVER_IP`](https://learn.hashicorp.com/consul/security-networking/datacenters#join-the-servers) can be used to join one datacenter to another
