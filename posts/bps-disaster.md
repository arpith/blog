# [BP's Disaster](http://motherjones.com/environment/2010/05/oil-spill-bp-grand-isle-beach)

> It's Saturday, May 22nd, a month into the BP spill, and I've been trying to get to Elmer's Island for the past two days. I've been stymied at every turn by Jefferson Parish sheriff's deputies brought in to supplement the local police force of Grand Isle, a 300-year-old settlement here at the very southern tip of Louisiana.

Understandably, BP is having issues with the press (and indeed, everyone concerned).

> I tell her I don't understand why I can't see Elmer's Island unless I'm escorted by BP. She tells me BP's in charge because "it's BP's oil."
