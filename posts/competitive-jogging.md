# [Competitive Jogging](http://www.runnersworld.com/article/1,7124,s6-243-297--13462-0,00.html)

> Runners, men in particular, hate getting passed. Often, they're passed by Elise, my fast wife. This they can't stand. Especially when she's pushing a jogging stroller. Especially when the stroller has both our daughters in it. Especially when our daughters are carrying weights. So the poor guys try to stay with her, breathing heavily just off her shoulder. Elise finds this irritating, this unasked-for competition on her afternoon run.
