# [The Mewar Complex](http://indianbydesign.wordpress.com/2010/05/28/archi-feature-mewar-complex/)

> The Mewar Complex is a loose cluster of three main memorials – Yuddh Smarak, Vijay Smarak and Raj Tilak Sthal. Each commemorates a specific event, serving to narrate the story of Rana Pratap’s life in chapters.  The Complex alters the desert landscape for those who pass by. What are we to make of them? How do they affect our interaction with the desert and the countless stories buried in the sand? Does a memorial commemorating Rana Pratap need to look like how he would have built it in war-torn feudal times, or how we see him in our democratic present? Does the past need to be represented as a mime or as an understanding? Much of this forms the conversation with one of the architects of the project, Meghal Arya.
