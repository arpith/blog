<blockquote>And some time make the time to drive out west<br/>
Into County Clare, along the Flaggy Shore,<br/>
In September or October, when the wind<br/>
And the light are working off each other<br/>
So that the ocean on one side is wild<br/>
With foam and glitter, and inland among stones<br/>
The surface of a slate-grey lake is lit<br/>
By the earthed lightning of a flock of swans,<br/>
Their feathers roughed and ruffling, white on white,<br/>
Their fully grown headstrong-looking heads<br/>
Tucked or cresting or busy underwater. <br/>
Useless to think youâ€™ll park and capture it<br/>
More thoroughly. You are neither here nor there,<br/>
A hurry through which known and strange things pass<br/>
As big soft buffetings come at the car sideways <br/>
And catch the heart off guard and blow it open.</blockquote>
