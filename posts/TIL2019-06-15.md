# Things I learnt 15 June 2019
* when setting up acl replication between two datacenters you've joined in a wan, there is an interesting edge case
  * in consul 1.4, you can continue to use the old style config
  * however, if you use the new style config you need to remember to set `enable_token_replication`to true :)
* `consul operator area create` creates a network area (do this in both datacenters)
* `consul operator area join OTHER_DATACENTER_IP` joins the two network areas - you only need to run this in one datacenter
* ruby 1.9 seems to try to interpret strings as ASCII, this behavior was flipped to UTF-8 in 2.x
* cloudtrail logs can be used to figure out the calls terraform is making
* there's an [unofficial list](https://github.com/rvedotrc/aws-iam-reference/blob/master/all-actions.txt) of iam actions (made in 2018)
