* This [cool IAM policy](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40513132/give-an-instance-only-access-to-tag-itself) lets an instance only tag itself - in general this kind of condition looks pretty handy!
* [`facter ec2_instance_id`](https://github.com/puppetlabs/docs-archive/blob/master/facter/2.0/core_facts.markdown) gets the instance id when you're on the instance :) 
* [hiera lookup](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.2/hiera_use_function.html) lets you specify a default

* `eval "$(rbenv init -)"` lets you avoid having to use `rbenv exec ruby...`to set the ruby version
* Puppet has a [cron resource](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.3/types/cron.html)
